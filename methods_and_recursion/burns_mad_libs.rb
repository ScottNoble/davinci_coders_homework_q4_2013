#O my Luve's like a red, red rose
#That’s newly sprung in June;
#O my Luve's like the melodie
#That’s sweetly play'd in tune.

#As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
#So deep in luve am I:
#And I will luve thee still, my dear,
#Till a’ the seas gang dry:

#Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
#And the rocks melt wi’ the sun:
#I will luve thee still, my dear,
#While the sands o’ life shall run.

#And fare thee well, my only Luve
#And fare thee well, a while!
#And I will come again, my Luve,
#Tho’ it were ten thousand mile.
